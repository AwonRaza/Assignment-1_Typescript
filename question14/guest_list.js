    I hope this message finds you well. I was wondering if you would like to join me for dinner on 15-2-23 at 8:00pm. It would be great to catch up and spend some quality time together over a delicious meal.
    
    Let me know if you're available and we can decide on a place to meet. I'm looking forward to seeing you soon!
    
    Best regards,
    Aoun Malik`;
